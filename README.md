## Introduction

This project is a simple news reader application built using Python. It fetches the latest news articles from an API and displays them in a Tkinter GUI. The application allows users to navigate through the news articles and read more details by opening the full article in a web browser.

## Features

- Fetch the latest news articles from the NewsData.io API.
- Display each news article with an image, title, and description.
- Navigate through the news articles using "Next" and "Prev" buttons.
- Open the full article in a web browser by clicking the "Read More" button.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests library
- Pillow library
- Tkinter

## API Configuration
- Ensure you have a valid API key from NewsData.io. Update the API key in the script.

## Troubleshooting
- If an article does not have an image, a default "No Image Available" image will be displayed.
- Ensure that you have a valid API key and that the API endpoint is reachable.
